# Diagnoses Digestive Diseases

in this project, we try to build a knowledge base system to diagnoses some diseases.
we use experta in python which is a simple framework that makes build system like that not too hard.
there is a pdf that explains how we build the project for each step I hope you find it useful and learn to build a good program that shows your creativity. 
all you need to run this project is to have jupyter-notebook and python.


the library you need is just experta.      
you can also run the code from terminal.    
the step:      
1- after you install experta     
2- open terminal     
3- <span style="color:red"> $python engine.py </span>
